More specifically, we show that if the (not necessarily convex) Hamiltonian is an increasing function, then the Poincaré constant is strictly decreasing in the inverse temperature, and vice versa. Applying this result to the $O(2)$ model allows us to give a sharpened upper bound on its Poincaré constant. We further show that this model exhibits a qualitatively different zero-temperature behavior of the Poincaré and Log-Sobolev constants.","tags":[],"title":"Monotonicity of the Poincaré and Log Sobolev Constants of One Dimensional Gibbs Measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Beaud","Julian Sieber","Simone Warzel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1545350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545350400,"objectID":"2fe929b6dcf1363ad49fb5b1efcc821c","permalink":"https://julian-sieber.github.io/publication/bounds-on-the-bipartite-entanglement-entropy-for-oscillator-systems-with-or-without-disorder/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T18:31:27+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bounds-on-the-bipartite-entanglement-entropy-for-oscillator-systems-with-or-without-disorder/","section":"publication","summary":"We give a direct alternative proof of an area law for the entanglement entropy of the ground state of disordered oscillator systems---a result due to Nachtergaele, Sims and Stolz. Instead of studying the logarithmic negativity, we invoke the explicit formula for the entanglement entropy of Gaussian states to derive the upper bound. We also contrast this area law in the disordered case with divergent lower bounds on the entanglement entropy of the ground state of one-dimensional ordered oscillator chains.","tags":[],"title":"Bounds on the bipartite entanglement entropy for oscillator systems with or without disorder","type":"publication"}]
