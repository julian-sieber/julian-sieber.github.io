As an application, we establish weak convergence of the solutions of  rough differential equations (RDE) of the form $$ dx^\\varepsilon_t=\\frac 1  {\\sqrt \\varepsilon}  f(x_t^\\varepsilon,y_{\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon}})\\,dt+g(x_t^\\varepsilon)\\,d\\mathbf{B}_t,$$ and identify their limits as solutions of an RDE driven by a Gaussian field with  a drift coming from the Lévy area correction of the limiting rough driver. The equation models a passive tracer in a random field.\nIn particular if $h$ is random field such that $h(x, \\cdot)$ a semi-martingale with spatial parameter $x$, we show that the solutions of the equations $$  dx^\\varepsilon_t=\\frac 1  {\\sqrt \\varepsilon}  f(x_t^\\varepsilon,y_{\\frac{t}{\\varepsilon}})\\,dt+h(x_t^\\varepsilon, dt),$$ converge weakly to that of a Kunita type  Itô SDE $dx_t=G(x_t,dt)$ where $G(x,t)$ is a semi-martingale with spatial parameters. Furthermore the $N$-point motions converge.","tags":[],"title":"Functional Limit Theorems for Volterra Processes and Applications to Homogenization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xue-Mei Li","Julian Sieber"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606953600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606953600,"objectID":"c83e40cf5100c0a44259750199db0299","permalink":"https://julian-sieber.github.io/publication/slow-fast-systems-with-fractional-environment-and-dynamics/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T18:57:58+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/slow-fast-systems-with-fractional-environment-and-dynamics/","section":"publication","summary":"We prove an averaging principle for interacting slow-fast systems driven by independent fractional Brownian motions.

More specifically, we show that if the (not necessarily convex) Hamiltonian is an increasing function, then the Poincaré constant is strictly decreasing in the inverse temperature, and vice versa. Applying this result to the $O(2)$ model allows us to give a sharpened upper bound on its Poincaré constant. We further show that this model exhibits a qualitatively different zero-temperature behavior of the Poincaré and Log-Sobolev constants.","tags":[],"title":"Monotonicity of the Poincaré and Log Sobolev Constants of One Dimensional Gibbs Measures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Vincent Beaud","Julian Sieber","Simone Warzel"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1545350400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1545350400,"objectID":"2fe929b6dcf1363ad49fb5b1efcc821c","permalink":"https://julian-sieber.github.io/publication/bounds-on-the-bipartite-entanglement-entropy-for-oscillator-systems-with-or-without-disorder/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T18:31:27+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/bounds-on-the-bipartite-entanglement-entropy-for-oscillator-systems-with-or-without-disorder/","section":"publication","summary":"We give a direct alternative proof of an area law for the entanglement entropy of the ground state of disordered oscillator systems---a result due to Nachtergaele, Sims and Stolz.
